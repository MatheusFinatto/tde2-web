<h1 style="font-size: 32px;">This project is a bootstrap design for website using only HTML and CSS features.</h1>



This project was made for college classes, but I think it went pretty well, and should gain it's place here on my GitHub.

PS: If you're wondering "why is there a sidebar in a pizzaria website design?", the answer is that the main demand of the professor was to use grid system, including a sidebar (i wouldn't personally add one if it was not a demand, since I don't think the business model demands a sidebar).



<h2 style="font-size: 24px;"> <i>To run this project</i>: just download the repo, and open the index.html file with a web browser.</h2>
