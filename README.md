This project is a bootstrap design for website using only HTML and CSS features.

It was made for college classes, but I think it went pretty well, and should gain it's place here on my GitHub.

PS: If you're wondering "why is there a sidebar in a pizzaria website design?", the answer is that the main demand of the professor was to use grid system, including a sidebar (i wouldn't personally add one if it was not a demand, since I don't think the business model demands a sidebar).
